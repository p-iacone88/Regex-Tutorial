# Regex Tutorial

In this guide I'd like to walk through the details of Regex, otherwise known as regular expression syntax. We'll start by breaking down each component by providing a code example and a detailed explanation. As a web development student, understanding regex can be extremely helpful for dissecting and understanding search patterns defined in code.

## Summary

Let's look at this regex `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/` which is used to match or validate a URL. This line dissects the components such as domain, protocol, path, and optional parameters.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

```javascript
/^
```

To start, this regex uses the `^` anchor to represent the start of the string and the `$` anchor to assert the end. This will ensure the entire string is matched.
